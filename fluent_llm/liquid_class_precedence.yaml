# Liquid class precedence configuration
#
# This file defines precedence rules for selecting a liquid class when compiling
# an advanced worklist.  In simple scripts the liquid class may be defined in
# the controlling code (script), but for advanced worklists the liquid class
# specified within the worklist should take precedence.  Adjust these
# settings to suit your robot and process requirements.

liquid_class_precedence:
  # Use the liquid class defined in the controlling script by default
  default: script
  # When generating or running an advanced worklist, prefer the class
  # specified within the worklist itself over the script-defined class
  advanced_worklist: worklist
